>Â Get your very own standing desk statistics with your Espressif ESP32

What it looks like? Nothing at this moment.

## Requirements

This is the setup I think I will use :

- [ESP32 Feather Board](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3619)
- [IR distance sensor (20cm-150cm)](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1031) for desk height
- [IR distance sensor (10cm-80cm)](https://www.adafruit.com/product/164) for presence detection
